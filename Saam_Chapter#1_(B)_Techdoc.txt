Program Description: 
The program is analogous to the 8-ball toy generating a random response to a question based on a randomization of an answer subset.
The program uses a the randint function of the random package to create a number and prints the corresponding line from the 8ball_responses.txt file
---

Logical Steps:  
1. [Step 1: Ask user if they would like a response to a yes or no question]
2. [Step 2: If yes generate a random number]
3. [Step 3: filter random number into a file reading function to pull the corresponding	 text line from the 8ball response file]
4. [Step 4: print response from text file]
5. [Step 5: repeat process until user wishes to quit and enters ‘n’]

---

Variables:  
1. [ line_number: variable pulled into readline() from random number generation function]
2. [ count: static variable to create while loop and break with a response of no]
3.[useranswer: local variable in main function to receive and answer of y/n]

---

Functions:
1. Function Name: random()
   Description: generates a number 1-12 to correlate to the answer choices and returns the number 
   Returns: returns a random number (1-12)

2. Function Name: readline() 
   Description: The function takes an input from the random() function to pull one of the 12 responses from the 8ball text file and returns it.
   Function considers index and file exception errors.  
   Parameters: Random number 1-12 from random()
   Returns: random 8 ball answer
